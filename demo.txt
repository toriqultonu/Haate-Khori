Role: You are a Senior Android Developer specializing in Jetpack Compose and Game Development.

Task: Create a complete, single-file Jetpack Compose implementation for a kids' educational game called "Stick Builder."

Game Concept: Kids build numbers using sticks from a tray. The target layout is a 7-segment display pattern.

Core Requirements:

Data Structure: * Define a Segment data class with a rect: Rect, orientation: Orientation (Horizontal/Vertical), and isCorrect: Boolean.

Create a Stick data class with offset: Offset, rotation: Float, and id: UUID.

UI Layout:

Canvas Board: A large area featuring a faint "ghost" 7-segment display as a guide.

The Tray: A rounded box at the bottom containing several colored sticks.

Controls: A "Bulb" icon for hints (highlights correct segments) and a "Done" button to validate the answer.

Interaction Logic:

Drag & Drop: Implement pointerInput with detectDragGestures to move sticks from the tray to the board.

Two-Finger Rotation: Allow sticks to be rotated in 90-degree increments using two-finger gestures, or a double-tap to toggle orientation.

Snap-to-Grid: Implement a "Magnetic Snapping" feature. If a stick is released near one of the 7 ghost segments and the orientation matches, it should animate (Animatable) perfectly into the center of that segment.

Game Logic:

Provide a function checkAnswer(targetNumber: Int) that returns true if all required segments for that number
 are occupied by a stick.

Add a "Reset" function to clear the board and return sticks to the tray.

Visual Style:

Use a playful, child-friendly color palette (Primary colors for sticks).

Use RoundedCornerShape for all sticks to look like popsicle sticks.

Include a "Success" animation (like a pulsing scale effect) when the number is correct.

Output: Please provide the full Kotlin code using Jetpack Compose, including the state management logic using remember and mutableStateListOf.
